# Harmonic Visualizer
This is a program to visualize the effect of harmonic's magnitude and its phase on the waveform, IHD and THD. You can add number of harmonic elements in the program and see its effect on the resultant wave as shown below:

Or individual waves as well as resultant waves of harmonics can be seen as shown below:
