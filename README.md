# Harmonic Visualizer
This is a program to visualize the effect of harmonic's magnitude and its phase on the waveform, IHD and THD. 
Working of the app is shown below:

You can add number of harmonic elements in the program and see its effect on the resultant wave as shown below:

Or individual waves as well as resultant waves of harmonics can be seen as shown below:

## App options:
**Number of Harmonic Contents:** This is the order of the max harmonic element desired in the plot.
**Show all waves:** It either shows individual harmonic waves as well as resultant wave in the plot or only resultant wave.
**Lock plot:** This locks the plot axis.
**% Total harmonic Distortion:** This shows percent of harmonic distortion present in the wave.
**Magnitude/phase Switch:**  This switches the slider control to Magnitude or phase control.
**Slider:** This control Magnitude/phase values of the respective harmonic component.

## This app is based on MATLAB App Designer.

## Instructions:

1. Download all the files in one folder <br />
2. Run thd_ihd.mplapp to directly run the app 
                or
   Open thd_ihd_exported.m in MATLAB Code window and then run the app .
