# Harmonic Visualizer
This is a program to visualize the effect of harmonic's magnitude and its phase on the waveform, IHD and THD. 
Working of the app is shown below:

You can add number of harmonic elements in the program and see its effect on the resultant wave as shown below:

Or individual waves as well as resultant waves of harmonics can be seen as shown below:

## Instructions:

1. Download all the files in one folder <br />
2. Run thd_ihd.mplapp to directly run the app 
                or
   Open thd_ihd_exported.m in MATLAB Code window and then run the app .
